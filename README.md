# Playing-In-Traffic
Attempting to create a drag and drop Traffic simulator as practice coding and if all goes well a fun little game.

Need cars with AI
  Select Location
  Pick perfect path to location
  Drive to location obeying Road events. 
  
An AI might have traits like always going to work on weekdays and spending large amounts of time there before
comming home. 


Need Locations
  Houses where cars start and end
  Locations where cars can go and spend time such as office buildings and hospitals
  
 
Need road surfaces
  Places where cars can travel
  Intersections
  Overpasses
  Construction
  Multilane
  User interactble to allow simulation of different situations. 
  
All this is housed in a 2D simulation space the user can use to interacte with elements such as cars and roads. 


Eventually the user should be able to build city scapes roller coaster tycoon style unlocking different elements and achieveing different objecticves.

Success will depend on users ability to manage different events such as contruction time, traffic light timmings while building a complex network of nodes and managing an ever increasing level of populations.
